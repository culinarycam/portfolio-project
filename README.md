# Portfolio Project

In this project, I will create a professional portfolio page using the skills I have learned with HTML and CSS.

## Acceptance Criteria
```

It is done when I have my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
When I click on the navigation links, it jumps to that part of the page
When I click on the link for my work, it jumps to that section
When I present my first application, it will be bigger than the other applications
When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, they layout will change for each device
